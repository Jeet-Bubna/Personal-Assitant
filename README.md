### DFA and NFA systems for keyword detection
**As of 30-8-25**  
DFA and NFA are a part of the REGEX (Regular Expression). This is used to find certain phrases in a given string easily. This is done by the python `re` module.  
What is regex: Reg ex: regular expresssions, faster than looping over each text to find keywords, instead compile the keywords into a pattern and search the text with it, there are 2 types of engines used to perform regex: DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) and NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton)
